# Deno Modules

This repository contains Deno modules that I have created, but they are available for anyone to import.

| Module | Exports | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| [prompt_utils](https://github.com/tommardh/deno_modules/blob/master/prompt_utils/README.md) | writeToPrompt, getInputFromPrompt, ask | These functions makes it a bit easier to work with simple input and output from stdin and to stdout |
| [type_wrapper](https://github.com/tommardh/deno_modules/blob/master/type_wrapper/README.md) | TypeWrapper, type ITypeWrapper | Makes it easier to wrap primitives and strings as well as class collections |
